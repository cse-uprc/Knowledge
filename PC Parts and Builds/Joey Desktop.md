Name: Joey Kilgore  
Reason for computer: Programming, Machine Learning, Audio editing/recording    
Approx Cost: ~$1100 for the whole tower, no peripherals
  
## Main components
These were ordered in April of 2018  
CPU: i5-8600K, 6-core 3.6GHz (4.3 GHz Turbo) (~250)  
Motherboard: ASRock Z370 Killer (~150)   
RAM: 2x8 GB DDR4 2400 G.SKILL Ripjaws V series (~175)  
GPU: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB (~300)  
Power Supply: Rosewill Hive Series 650W Modular Gamin Power Supply (~60)  
Case: Phanteks Eclipse P440S (~80)  
Drives: Boot-Samsung 860 EVO 2.5" 250GB SSD, Storage-WD Blue 1TB HDD (~80,~45)  
Why these parts:  
The motherboard, and CPU, (and maybe something else) were sold as a bundle, which saved about 60 bucks. The 2 sticks of ram meant I had enough now (usually you don't need more than 16 GB) but could still upgrade relatively easily down the line. The SSD and HDD are pretty standard, I went with cheap but still enough space that it wouldn't be a problem. The case was just watever is cheap. The graphics card is something specific for machine learning. Basically, this was the best GPU at the time I could fit into the budget. The 6GB variant was very important, because the larger on board GDDR5 is needed when processing very large datasets. It will be a while before I need to upgrade this, but there is always the M.2 slots for NVMe drives which is an easy upgrade if I choose to do at some point.  

## Peripherals
Monitor(s): 32" 1080p Insignia TV, 27" 1080p Dell Monitor (~150, ~150)  
Mouse: Whatever is cheap and probably already somewhere in my house (preferably wireless)  
Keyboard: Microsoft Ergonomic Sculpt (~70)  
Why these:    
The TV was chosen because it was the cheapest screen I could get for that size and resolution. The Monitor was chosen because it was the cheapest for that size and can be oriented vertically without needing a special stand. The keyboard is close to my heart, IT IS NOT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ACTUALLY GAME EVER, but after using it my wrists feel soooooooooo much better compared to a normal keyboard.  

## Extras  
I do some music recording on my computer. I use a focusrite solo and an AT2020 mic. Gives a good sound.  
ALSO, my chair has a pillow on it. I highly recommend anyone that sits in a chair for extended periods of time to have a pillow behind your lower back. It forces you to sit up straight and improve your posture. Don't be like me and have poor posture and need to go to physical therapy. Trust me, it works, its easy.  

## Overall thoughts and comments  
Honestly, this was a bit expensive for a computer, but it was worth it. Considering I'm going to be using it a ton throughout the next few years for school/projects, it was a worthwhile investment. Also, you don't need to build your computer like I did. There are pre built machines that probably now have better specs and are less expensive than my build. Look around, try and find deals, and don't be afraid to ask around if you have no idea what you are doing!
