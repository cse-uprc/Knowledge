Name:  Peter Georgas
Reason for computer: Gaming
Approx Cost: ~$1300 When I bought it over the times. 
## Main components (Keep in mind, this was how much I paid when I originally began upgrading. It doesn't make sense to get these parts now, as newer ones are out.)
CPU: Ryzen 5 1600 OC to 3.8GHz  (~$180)
CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO + 2 Corsair SP120 120mm Static Pressure fans ($25 + $25)
Motherboard: ASUS PRIME B350-PLUS (~$90)
RAM: Corsair LPX DDR4-3000 2x8GB [16GB] (~$150 during the ram shortage)
GPU: EVGA GTX 1080 FTW ACX 3.0 (~$615. This was during the crazy crypto boom, ended up selling my 1070 for $600 and getting the 1080 effectively for $15)
Power Supply: EVGA Supernova NEX 650G Fully-Modular 80+Gold (~$60)
Case: Phanteks P400 TG Black/White ($70)
Drives: 240 GB PNY CS1311 SSD ($75 in 2017), 1TB Samsung 860 EVO ($150 during flash memory shortage), 1TB Seagate Barracuda 7200RPM HDD ($70 in 2009 -- still spinning!)  
Why these parts:  So I went with Ryzen because of how great of a value it was at the time. It still, to this day is an awesome value. In addition to this, I also went with it
for a good upgrade path because of the rumors initially of how great Zen 2 (coming Q1/Q2 of 2019) is going to be. 16GB of ram because I was actually getting microstutters in a lot of games
with my 8GB of patriot memory. GTX 1080 was basically a godsent upgrade. I initially had a R9 290 in my PC, i sold that at the start of the crypto boom in June of 2017 and bought a GTX 1070
which I ended up selling for $600 in January of 2018 during the crpyo-currency hell and was able to somehow snipe a GTX 1080 from Newegg at 6 AM for $615 (the 15 was for shipping)

## Peripherals
Monitor(s):  ASUS VG248QE 144hz, and some garbage HP 1050p monitor
Mouse: Ducky One 2 TKL RGB
Keyboard:  Logitech G Pro Wireless
Why these:  
I love Cherry MX Brown switches.
Wireless mouse in 2019 is truly something I never realized I would love until I got one. G Pro wireless is definitely overpriced, but is an amazing mouse. 
## Extras  

I also have a 36" Logitech G840 Mousepad for tons of space, as I play FPS mostly on very low sens.
  

## Overall thoughts and comments
I'm very excited to upgrade in the future, as I believe this is the year AMD completely closes the performance gap compared to Intel with Zen 2. Currently, it runs everything I throw at it at around 144 FPS if I knock down some stupid pointless settings.

Would definitely NOT recommend buying GTX 10 series cards anymore NEW , as they are out of production and there is limited supply which drives up the price of
NEW 10 series Graphics Cards. I would definitely recommend buying these used, and EVGA if you can(3 year warranty that's user-transferrable is something aweseome).
