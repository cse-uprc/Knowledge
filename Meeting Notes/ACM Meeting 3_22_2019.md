* Discussed Election  
  * **Chair:** Joey Kilgore
  * **Co-Chair:** Joe Davis
  * **Secretary:** Jared Maki
* Becoming an Official Chapter
  * Dr. Thomas has been contacted, recomended to contact Dr. Hobbs to ask about being a Faculty Representative
* Competitive Programming
  * Meetings every other Saturday
* Tech News
  * ACM has a mailing list for members w/ great articles
  * Facebook stored millions of passwords in plain text within internal database
* Machine learning presentation
  * Building Neural Network from scratch
  * Activation Funcs.
  * Back-propagation
    * Cost Function
    * Cost Function -> Gradient -> Weight adjustments
      * Change weights to minimize costs
    * Chain Rule to get partial derivatives
    * New weight = old weight - (training rate) * gradient
      * training rate is a const. defined by programmer
* Discussed future meeting ideas
  * Interview/Professional Skills
  * How to adult
* Meeting adjourned @ 7:00pm
