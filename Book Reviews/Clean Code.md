Overview:  
Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hourrs and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. This book discusses the ways to make sure the code you write is clean. Lots of very helpful tips to know!

Review:  
Rarely do you think about keeping you code clean, but after coding for a few years you realize how important it is! I highly recommend this book. It really does bring to light some things I take for granted. If you plan to write code for a living, you should give this book a read!
