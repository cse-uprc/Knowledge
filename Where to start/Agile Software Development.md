# Agile Software Development

## What is it?  
"Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, it's generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context." - [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

Agile is more of a process of developing anything (not just software) in a way that can quickly respond to change.  

### Key Concepts  
**User Stories**: User stories are the key to what work needs to be done to the software.  

**Daily Meetings**: Yes, a meeting everyday. Sometimes reffered to as a 'standup' where everyone share 3 things. What did you do yesterday? What are you going to do today? Do you have any road blocks?  

**Incremental Development**: Essentially, every change is made such that each successive version is usable.

**Milestone Retrospective**: At the end of a project, all of the team's members (not just the devs), look back and analyze the projects significant events. This allows the team to find what worked well, what didn't, and what can be done to work better.

## 12 Principles
These principles are outlined in the Agile Manifesto, and are the cornerstone of the Agile process.  
1 - "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software." This means that there are more smaller, continuous updates given to customers. Allowing for more immediate feedback, and more immediate improvements.  
2 - "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage." Because the customer is continously part of making the incremental changes, feedback can come during development to improve the quality of the software without needing to finish an entire year of work.  
3 - "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." Software changes are made regularly in small increments. This allows for faster delivery of these changes.
