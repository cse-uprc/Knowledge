# Agile Software Development

## What is it?  
"Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, it's generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context." - [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

Agile is more of a process of developing anything (not just software) in a way that can quickly respond to change.  

### Key Concepts  
**User Stories**: User stories are the key to what work needs to be done to the software.  

**Daily Meetings**: Yes, a meeting everyday. Sometimes reffered to as a 'standup' where everyone shares 3 things. What did you do yesterday? What are you going to do today? Do you have any road blocks?  

**Incremental Development**: Essentially, every change is made such that each successive version is usable.

**Milestone Retrospective**: At the end of a project, all of the team's members (not just the devs), look back and analyze the projects significant events. This allows the team to find what worked well, what didn't, and what can be done to work better.

## 12 Principles
These principles are outlined in the Agile Manifesto, and are the cornerstone of the Agile process.  
1 - "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."  
This means that there are more smaller, continuous updates given to customers. Allowing for more immediate feedback, and more immediate improvements.  

2 - "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."  
Because the customer is continously part of making the incremental changes, feedback can come during development to improve the quality of the software without needing to finish an entire year of work. 
    
3 - "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."   
Software changes are made regularly in small increments. This allows for faster delivery of these changes.  

4 - "Business people and developer must work together daily throughout the project."  
This emphasizes how much collaboritive work goes on in Agile. Communication between business people and software devs ensures the customer gets the most accurate information, and the developers know what they should be focusing on.  

5 - "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."  
This gives the control of the software to the software people, but they have to be motivated to make the software!  

6 - "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."  
Real in person communication has such a greater impact than an email chain. It's faster, allows for conversations to flow, and generally its only as hard as walking across the office to someones desk.  

7 - "Working software is the primary measure of progress."  
It doesn't matter how many lines of code you write, or how much documentation there is. At the end of the day, is there new working software. The key being 'WORKING' software.  

8 - "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinetely."  
It's not about getting one task done as fast as possible. It's about creating a process where there is consistent work done that benefits the sponsors and users.  

9 - "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."  
Building software with good design, ie well planned, allows for developers to easily adjust as requirements change.  

10 - "Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."  
Every problem has millions of solutions, and overtime you only come up with more possible solutions. Agile picks the simplicest solution.  

11 - "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."  
Teams that figure out their own organization are able to create better designs. 

12 - "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."  
This is key. Working as a team will always have problems. Spending time to figure out how to overcome these problems makes the team more efficient, happier, and overall produces a better work envirnment and better software.
