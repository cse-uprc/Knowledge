# Overview / General

Vim is a free terminal-based text editor with a vast and powerful array of keyboard shortcuts which allow the user to work quickly with a minimal amount of keystrokes.  For instance, you can select several lines at once and indent/unindent them a specific number of spaces, or replace anything inside of quotation marks within a certain segment of the file with a specific string, or do a very quick find-and-replace (ideal for changing names of variables or functions).  Many modern, GUI-based IDEs (such as Eclipse or Atom) have extensions available which allow the user to work in "Vim Mode," so even if you don't want to use the terminal, you can still benefit from the efficiency of these commands.  The downside is that, with the overwhelming number of keyboard commands (and their often counterintuitive implementation), the learning curve can be quite steep.  Somewhat famously, there is a stackoverflow submission (with thousands of upvotes) simply asking how to exit the program.

This file is intended to contain resources which can make the process of learning Vim less painful (please feel free to add to it with any resources you know of).

# Vim Adventures

An online HTML5 game that teaches Vim by using the Vim keyboard shortcuts as controls.  I think you have to pay after the first few levels (though I'm not sure; it's been a few years since I've played it).  Url here: https://vim-adventures.com/

# The Docs
