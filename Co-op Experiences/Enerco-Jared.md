**Company:** Enerco Group Incorporated  
**Position:** Support Application Developer  
**When:** Summer-Fall 2018  
**Who:** Jared Maki 

**Stuff I did:** Worked on maintaining and fixing the company's internal software used to automate data collection and visualization. I also developed new features as requested by employees and worked on some PLCs used on the assembly line.  


**Stuff I learned:**  
WPF Application Development with C#   
Database Querying with LINQ   
PLCs and Ladder Logic   
MVVM Architecture   

**Things I enjoyed:**   
Working with Joe  
Being able to wire up a PLC

**Things I didn't enjoy:**  
The lack of any guidance and mentorship   
Bad factory conditions and constant noise from assembly line    
Awful codebase with a lack of consistency and documentation   
Doing IT work periodically (The company has a separate IT Department)    
Poor upper management that changes project paramenters without informing our department   

**Overall thoughts:**   
My overall experience at Enerco was not great at all. I did do work that is relevant to our program, but the company's environment was flawed. Much of what I learned on the job was self-taught as we rarely had a mentor around to guide us through a problem. The only people working in our department
full-time in the fall were Joe Davis and I. I felt like I was being used throughout the internship and will not be returning for another co-op.
