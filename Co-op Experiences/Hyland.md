Overall thoughts:  
This was one of the greatest experiences of my life. Hyland really strives to give an evirnment that encourages learning for their interns. The first week I spent dedicated to learning how to build C# applications. All interns worked with at least one other intern and we all had a manager and a developer dedicated to being our mentor. Once we finally got into the swing of things, I don't remember a day where I wasn't happy to wake up and go to work. One of the hardest decisions I've had to make, was deciding not to come back for the summer of 2019.
